In React, the lifecycle of a component refers to the various stages a component goes through, from its creation to its removal from the DOM. React provides lifecycle methods that allow you to perform actions at specific points in a component's life.

Class Component Lifecycle Methods:
Mounting Phase:

constructor(): The constructor is called before a component is mounted. It is used for initializing state and binding event handlers.

static getDerivedStateFromProps(): This method is called right before rendering and can be used to update the state based on props.

render(): This is the method that actually returns React elements to be rendered.

componentDidMount(): This method is called after the component has been rendered to the DOM. It is commonly used for making network requests or interacting with the DOM.

Updating Phase:

static getDerivedStateFromProps(): Similar to the mounting phase, it is also called before rendering during updates.

shouldComponentUpdate(): This method is called before rendering, and it allows you to control whether the component should update or not.

render(): Renders the updated component.

getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(): This method is called right before the changes from the virtual DOM are to be reflected in the actual DOM. It allows you to capture information from the DOM before it changes.

componentDidUpdate(): Called after the component has been updated in the DOM. It is often used for side effects like fetching data based on prop changes.

Unmounting Phase:

componentWillUnmount(): This method is called just before a component is unmounted and destroyed. It is used for cleanup such as cancelling network requests or cleaning up subscriptions.
React Hooks:
With the introduction of Hooks in React, functional components can now also use lifecycle-like methods with the useEffect hook. The equivalent hooks are:

useEffect(() => {}, []): Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. It runs after every render unless a dependency array is provided, in which case it runs when the specified dependencies change.

useLayoutEffect(() => {}, []): Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. It runs synchronously after all DOM mutations.

useEffect(() => { return () => {} }, []): Similar to componentWillUnmount. It cleans up effects from the previous render.
