The main problem with using .then() and .catch() for handling promises is that it can lead to "callback hell" or "pyramid of doom". This happens when you have a sequence of asynchronous operations that need to be performed one after the other. In such cases, the code can become deeply nested and hard to read.

For example:

```js
fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((data) => {
    processData(data);
    return fetch("https://api.example.com/otherData");
  })
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((otherData) => {
    processOtherData(otherData);
    return fetch("https://api.example.com/moreData");
  })
  .then((response) => response.json())
  .then((moreData) => {
    processMoreData(moreData);
  })
  .catch((error) => {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  });
```

This can become difficult to manage, especially when you have a large number of asynchronous operations.

Async/await and try/catch provide a more synchronous-looking way to work with promises, making the code more readable and easier to understand.

With async/await:

```js
async function fetchData() {
  try {
    const response = await fetch("https://api.example.com/data");
    const data = await response.json();
    processData(data);

    const otherResponse = await fetch("https://api.example.com/otherData");
    const otherData = await otherResponse.json();
    processOtherData(otherData);

    const moreResponse = await fetch("https://api.example.com/moreData");
    const moreData = await moreResponse.json();
    processMoreData(moreData);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error:", error);
  }
}
```

This code structure is much cleaner and easier to follow. It looks like synchronous code, even though it's working with asynchronous operations.

So, async/await along with try/catch simplifies the handling of asynchronous operations and makes the code more readable, maintainable, and less error-prone compared to chaining multiple .then() and .catch() blocks.
