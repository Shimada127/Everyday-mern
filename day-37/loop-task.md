- Loops with Arrays:

-> Looping through an Array:
Write a loop to print out all elements of an array of numbers.

Sum of Array Elements:
Write a loop to calculate and print the sum of all elements in an array.

Finding Maximum Value:

Filtering Even Numbers:
Write a loop to create a new array containing only the even numbers from an existing array of numbers.

Reversing an Array:
Write a loop to reverse the elements in an array (without using the reverse method).

Checking for Presence:

- Loops with Objects:

-> Looping through Object Properties:
Write a loop to print out all properties of an object.

Sum of Object Values:
Write a loop to calculate and print the sum of all values in an object (assuming all values are numbers).

Finding Maximum Value in Object:

Counting Properties:
Write a loop to count the number of properties in an object.

Filtering Objects:
Write a loop to create a new object containing only key-value pairs that meet a specific condition (e.g., all values greater than 10).

Checking for Key Existence:
