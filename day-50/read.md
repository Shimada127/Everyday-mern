Shallow Copy and Deep Copy:

Explanation: A shallow copy creates a new object, but doesn't create copies of nested objects. A deep copy creates a new object and also creates copies of all the nested objects.
Teaching Idea: Use a set of nested boxes as an analogy. Show that making a shallow copy just copies the outer box, but a deep copy creates new boxes inside as well.
JSON.parse & JSON.stringify:

Explanation: JSON.parse converts a JSON string into a JavaScript object, and JSON.stringify converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string.
Teaching Idea: Use a pretend language (e.g., "JSONish") and show how it's like translating between two different languages. JSON.parse is like understanding spoken language and JSON.stringify is like writing it down.
Handling Undefined & Null:

Explanation: undefined means a variable has been declared but has not been assigned a value, while null is an assignment value representing no value or no object.
Teaching Idea: Use a "to-do list" analogy. An empty slot on the list is like undefined (you know it's there, but nothing is written), and a slot with "N/A" or "None" is like null (you explicitly say there's no task).
Pass by Value:

Explanation: In JavaScript, primitive types (like numbers, strings, etc.) are passed by value, meaning a copy of the value is passed to a function.
Teaching Idea: Use a toy car. When you give it to a friend, they get a new toy car. If they paint it a different color, it doesn't affect your original car.
Pass by Reference:

Explanation: Objects (and arrays) are passed by reference in JavaScript, meaning that if you change the object inside a function, it affects the original object.
Teaching Idea: Use a shared coloring book. If one person colors a page, everyone sees the change. But if you give one person a new coloring book, their changes don't affect the original.
Comparison between For Loops:

Explanation: There are several types of loops in JavaScript (for, while, do-while, for-in, for-of). Each has its own use cases and performance considerations.
Teaching Idea: Have a race between different types of toy cars. The "fastest" one depends on the track (or task) you give them. Explain that different loops are good for different situations.
