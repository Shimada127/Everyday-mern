Task 1: Variables and Data Types
Write a program that declares a variable for each of the following data types: string, number, boolean, and array. Assign a value to each variable and print them to the console.

Task 2: Conditionals (if-else)
Write a program that takes a student's grade (a number between 0 and 100) as input and logs their corresponding letter grade (A, B, C, D, or F).

Task 3: Loops (for and while)
Write a program that prints the first 10 natural numbers using both a for loop and a while loop.

Task 4: Functions
Write a function called calculateSum that takes two numbers as arguments and returns their sum. Call this function with different sets of numbers and print the results.

Task 5: Arrays and Array Methods
Create an array of your favorite fruits.
Write a function called printFruits that takes an array of fruits as a parameter and prints each fruit to the console.
Use the push method to add a new fruit to the array.
Use the pop method to remove the last fruit from the array.
Task 6: Objects
Create an object representing a book with properties like title, author, and year published.
Write a function called getBookInfo that takes a book object as a parameter and logs its information.

<!-- string methods -->

String Methods:
Task 1: Reverse a String

Write a function called reverseString that takes a string as input and returns the reversed version of the string. For example, if the input is "hello", the function should return "olleh".

Task 2: Count Vowels

Write a function called countVowels that takes a string as input and returns the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in the string.

Task 3: Capitalize First Letter

Write a function called capitalizeFirstLetter that takes a string as input and capitalizes the first letter. For example, if the input is "hello", the function should return "Hello".

<!-- array methods -->

Array Methods:
Task 1: Find the Maximum

Write a function called findMax that takes an array of numbers as input and returns the maximum value.

Task 2: Filter Even Numbers

Write a function called filterEvenNumbers that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the even numbers.

Task 3: Concatenate Arrays

Write a function called concatArrays that takes two arrays as input and returns a new array that is a concatenation of the two input arrays.

Task 4: Find Unique Elements

Write a function called findUnique that takes an array of numbers as input and returns a new array containing only the unique elements (no duplicates).

Task 5: Sort an Array

Write a function called sortArray that takes an array of strings as input and returns a new array with the strings sorted in alphabetical order.

These tasks will help your students practice using various string and array methods. They cover common operations and will solidify their understanding of these concepts. Let me know if you'd like further clarification or additional tasks!
