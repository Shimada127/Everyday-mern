In React, when you build a website or app, you often need to do things like:

Fetching data from the internet.
Updating the page when something changes.
Cleaning up tasks when a part of the website is not needed anymore.

React provides a special tool called useEffect to help with these tasks.

Think of useEffect like a helper that says, "Hey React, do something extra after you've finished showing the initial part of my app."

Here's a breakdown:

Fetching Data:
Imagine you have a part of your app that needs to get information from a server (like getting the latest weather data). You use useEffect to tell React to fetch this data after the rest of your app is ready.

```
useEffect(() => {
// Code here to fetch weather data
}, []); // The empty array means "run this only once after the initial render"

```

Updating the Page:
Let's say you have a counter that increases each time a button is clicked. You want to tell React, "Hey, if the counter changes, update the title of the page."

```
useEffect(() => {
document.title = `Counter: ${counter}`;
}, [counter]); // The array with 'counter' means "run this whenever the counter changes"
```

Cleaning Up:
Sometimes, when a part of your app is not needed anymore (like when you switch to a different page), you want to clean up things, so your app doesn't waste resources.

```
useEffect(() => {
// Code here for setup

return () => {
// Code here for cleanup when this part is not needed anymore
};
}, [dependency]); // The array with 'dependency' means "run this when 'dependency' changes"
```

In simple terms, useEffect is like giving React a little extra instruction booklet, telling it what to do after it finishes setting up your app. It's handy for handling things that happen outside of the regular user interactions.
