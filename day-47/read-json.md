Here are a few reasons why we use JSON.stringify():

Serialization: JSON.stringify() converts a JavaScript object into a JSON string. This process is called serialization. This string representation can be easily sent over the network or saved in a file.

Data Interchange: JSON is a standard format for data interchange. Many APIs and web services expect data to be sent or received in JSON format.

Storing Data: When working with databases or local storage, it's common to store data as strings. JSON strings are a convenient way to store structured data.

Compatibility: JSON is a language-independent data format, so it can be easily consumed by applications written in different programming languages.

Ease of Use: JSON is human-readable, making it easy for developers to inspect and understand the data.
