Why React ?

- large community support and facebook maintains it
- jsx which will convert to html
- large ecosystem -> like many tools and other library are available

- Virtual DOM

```bash
Virtual Dom: React introduces a virtual DOM, which is a lightweight copy of the actual DOM. When there are changes in the data or state of a component, React first updates the virtual DOM and then efficiently updates the actual DOM by calculating the difference (diffing) between the current and new virtual DOM. This process minimizes the number of direct manipulations to the DOM, leading to improved performance.
