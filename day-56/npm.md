1. What is npm?
   NPM (Node Package Manager) is a tool used in JavaScript development to manage and share code packages (libraries, frameworks, and tools).
   It comes bundled with Node.js, which is a JavaScript runtime that allows you to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser.

2. How npm Works:
   Developers create reusable pieces of code called "packages" and publish them to the npm registry.
   The npm registry is like a giant online store for these packages, where developers can share and download them.
   When you want to use a package in your project, you use npm to install it. Npm downloads the package from the registry and adds it to your project.
3. Why npm is Required:
   Code Reusability: Npm allows developers to reuse code created by others, saving time and effort.
   Dependency Management: Projects often depend on multiple libraries. Npm helps manage these dependencies by making sure the right versions are installed.
   Easy Updates: If a package gets updated with new features or bug fixes, npm makes it easy to update your project to the latest version.
4. Why Update npm Packages:
   Security: Updates often include security fixes, helping to keep your project safe from potential vulnerabilities.
   New Features: Updates may bring new features or improvements to the packages you use.
   Bug Fixes: Updates address issues and bugs found in previous versions, making your code more reliable.
5. What is Yarn:
   Yarn is another package manager for JavaScript. It does a similar job as npm but was developed to address some specific issues with npm.
   Yarn is faster and more reliable in handling dependencies.
