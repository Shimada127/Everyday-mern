Certainly! Below are MongoDB shell commands for common operations like creating a database, adding a collection, inserting data into the collection, and querying data.

1. Creating a Database:

```bash

use your_database_name
# Replace your_database_name with the name you want for your database.
```

2. Adding a Collection:

```bash

  db.createCollection("your_collection_name")
#    Replace your_collection_name with the name you want for your collection.
```

3. Inserting Data into a Collection:

```bash

   db.your_collection_name.insert({ key1: value1, key2: value2, ... })
#    Replace your_collection_name with the name of your collection and provide the key-value pairs for the data you want to insert.
```

Example:

```bash

db.my_collection.insert({ name: "John Doe", age: 25, email: "john@example.com" })
```

4. Finding All Documents in a Collection:

```bash

   db.your_collection_name.find()
 # Replace your_collection_name with the name of your collection.
```

5. Finding Specific Entry:

```bash

 db.your_collection_name.find({ key: value })
# Replace your_collection_name with the name of your collection. Specify the key-value pair to filter the documents.
```

Example:

```bash
db.my_collection.find({ name: "John Doe" })
```
