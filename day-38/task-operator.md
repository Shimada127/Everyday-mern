Task 1: Arithmetic Operations
Write a JavaScript program that takes two numbers as input and performs the following operations:

Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division

Task 2: Comparison Operators
Write a program that compares two numbers and logs whether they are equal, not equal, greater than, or less than each other.

Task 3: Logical Operators
Create a program that uses logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to combine multiple conditions and determine the outcome. For example, check if a number is both even and greater than 10.

Task 4: String Operations
Write a JavaScript program that concatenates two strings and also finds the length of the resulting string.

Task 5: Increment and Decrement Operators
Create a program that demonstrates the use of the increment (++) and decrement (--) operators. For example, increment a number by 1 and then decrement it by 1.

Task 6: Assignment Operators
Write a program that uses various assignment operators (+=, -=, \*=, /=) to modify the value of a variable. For example, start with a variable set to 10 and use different assignment operators to change its value.

Task 7: Ternary Operator
Write a program that uses the ternary operator to determine whether a given number is even or odd.

Task 8: Bitwise Operators (Optional - for more advanced learners)
Create a program that demonstrates the use of bitwise operators (AND, OR, XOR, NOT) on two binary numbers. For example, perform a bitwise AND operation on two binary numbers.
